## Go over the domain modeling articles

**Article on Domain Modeling (Sobol)**

- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. A properly articulated domain model can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.
- Here are some tips to follow when building your own domain models:
  - When modeling a single entity that will have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
  - Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
  - Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
  - Create instances using the `new` keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
  - Store each newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
  - Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

**"Understanding the Problem Domain Is the Hardest Part of Programming" (Sonmez)**

- Why problem domains are hard
- Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain

## Discussion of this week's project

We'll go over the basics of this week's assignment, address the problem domain, and discuss how it is going to evolve through the week.

Ultimately, we'll look at a fully functional version of the project and talk about how to organize the steps that go into building it.

We'll also do a code demo to show some of the techniques that will be needed for lab today, including:
- Working with images
- Working with color
- Working with Google Fonts
