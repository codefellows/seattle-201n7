      <p>Now then, let's play. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.</p>

        <p>If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. It is a lot of fun. You don't want to kill all your dark areas; they are very important. This piece of canvas is your world.</p>

        <p>We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. See there how easy that is. Let's get crazy. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.</p>

        <p>This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that. We'll do another happy little painting. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. You have to make those little noises or it won't work.</p>

        <p>We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. At home you have unlimited time.</p>

        <p>Let's get wild today. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Put it in, leave it alone. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there.</p>

        <p>It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. And right there you got an almighty cloud. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. There we go.</p>
